I'm a Graduate Data Scientist in Household Risk & Retail Pricing at Admiral Group PLC, a FTSE 100 Insurance firm. 

My work involves optimizing the pricing structure through advanced and traditional Statistical Modelling and Machine Learning approaches. I am particularly interested in Stochastic Optimization, Statistical Inference and Bayesian Machine Learning (and its applications in Reinforcement Learning and Bayesian Networks).
